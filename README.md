MunichMakerLab Website

this website has been built with astro and tries to minimize the gotchas and special purpose additions for maintainabilities sake.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [our guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).
Tl;dr: The actual pages of the website are in [src/pages](/src/pages/) and are mostly markdown. Adding another page should be as easy as just creating another file, copy-pasting the head section and customizing it and the page itself.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
