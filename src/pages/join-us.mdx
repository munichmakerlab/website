## Join us on Open Thursday

When? Every Thursday starting at 6 PM.

What? Open Thursdays are for everyone! You don't need to be a member to join us, and we'll be offering tours.
Get to know our space and equipment. We have 3D printers, a CNC router, a large laser cutter, microcontrollers, wood and metal tools, and cold drinks - all in the cozy atmosphere of our big industrial-style hall. Come by to help out, chat, and meet new people!

Where? Munich Maker Lab, Dachauer Str. 112h, 80636 München

But .. I can't make it on Thursdays.
No worries drop by anytime the status on our website shows Open.
