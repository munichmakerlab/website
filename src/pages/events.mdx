# Welcome to the Munich Maker Lab Events page!

Here you'll find all upcoming activities at the space. Unless in rare cases where it will be stated, no membership is required to attend. We do look forward to seeing you!

Events <strong style="color: #f89538;">marked in orange</strong> can be attended without registration - usually meetups or other open events. Regular events are:

- Plenum: A casual get-together to chat, collaborate, and work on projects. If you're new and want a tour of the lab, this is the perfect opportunity!
- Project and Cleanup Day: Our community event to refresh the space, improve the lab, and work on personal or group projects together.

Events <strong style="color: #3788d8;">marked in blue</strong> are workshops that do require a (free) registration in our ticketing system to attend. You can register via the calendar entry or by visiting our [Workshop Registration System](https://tickets.munichmakerlab.de/mumalab/courses/). Regular workshops are:

- 3D Printing Introduction
- Laser Cutter Introduction
- CNC Introduction
- Workshop Safety Courses
- Onboarding for New Members: You can also just stop by at certain times to get an onboarding. Learn more at [our wiki](https://wiki.munichmakerlab.de/wiki/Onboarding#Onboarding)
