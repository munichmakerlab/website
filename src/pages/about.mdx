The Munich Maker Lab is a non-profit organization, creating an open community 
workspace, where you can learn, teach, share, make, hack, create, enjoy or 
simply relax. We try to create an environment that supports the do-it-yourself, 
hacker, and maker culture by providing workspace, tools, and infrastructure to 
our members and everyone else.

## Support us

We need to pay rent for our space, maintenance for tools, and we'd also like 
to support projects that happen at the space. To do so, we need money. We try 
to cover our fixed costs with membership fees (20€ per month, 10€ if you're 
under 18). Being a member has some benefits, such as the possibility to get a 
key to the space. If you want to become a member and support us on a regular 
basis, please fill out our [membership form](https://wiki.munichmakerlab.de/images/6/62/Membership_Form_2024.pdf), 
and bring it to one of our meetings. However, being a member is not a 
prerequisite to use the space, so feel free to just stop by.

If you like what we do, and want to give us a quick boost: we also take 
donations. Since we are a non-profit organisation according to German law, we 
can send you a receipt, and you can hand it in with your taxes. Here's our 
bank details:
