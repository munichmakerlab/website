The Munich Maker Lab is a non-profit organization, creating an open community workspace, where you can learn, teach, share, make, hack, create, enjoy or simply relax. We try to create an environment that supports the do-it-yourself, hacker and maker culture by providing workspace, tools, and infrastructure to our members and everyone else.

Everyone is welcome to visit when our website indicates an open status, as we don't have fixed opening times apart from our open Thursday. We are a fully community-driven space and no one is paid for their contributions to the lab. 
Our members are an diverse group of tech-savvy and non-tech individuals alike. They come to build and explore new things, work on their personal projects, create improvements for the lab, make art, learn new skills or simply hang out – we're also a kind of social club where people gather and connect.

While most people at the lab speak German, we have agreed to use English as our written language and in our formal meetups so that international people can join as well.

The Hacking Room Project was started in April 2013 to create a new Hacker-/Makerspace in Munich. After less than a year, in February 2014, we founded the Munich Maker Lab e.V. and moved into our first space, a 25m² room at Werk1 München. A year later, we expanded and moved into new rooms in Obersendling. Since early 2017, we have a industrial space at the Kreativquartier.

## The Community Approach

At the Munich Maker Lab, we believe that great things happen when people take initiative, just like in open‑source software projects. Our space thrives because members and visitors contribute their time, ideas and skills to make it better. Whether it’s maintaining tools, organizing events, or developing new projects, everything only happens when someone takes it on.

We try to keep our organization and processes as open and transparent as possible. Everyone is welcome to get involved, suggest improvements and share responsibility. This approach can feel a bit unusual at first, especially if you’re used to more structured or hierarchical organizations, but it gives everyone the chance to shape the community and the space itself.

You don’t need a formal role to help out. Supporting the community can be as simple as taking on a small task, helping with one of our “Mini‑Jobs” or joining an open lab project. Every contribution, no matter how small, helps the space grow and stay alive.

In essence, the Munich Maker Lab works best when people *make it happen*-together.

We need to pay rent for our space, maintenance for tools and we'd also like 
to support projects that happen at the space. To do so, we need money. We try 
to cover our fixed costs with membership fees.

If you like what we do, and want to give us a quick boost: we also take 
donations. Since we are a non-profit organisation according to German law, we 
can send you a receipt, and you can hand it in with your taxes. Here's our
