## Join us on Open Thursday

Open Thursdays are for everyone! You don't need to be a member to join us, and we'll be giving tours!

It's Thursday, and time for another MuMaLab e.V. club meeting! We have 3D printers, a CNC router, a huge laser cutter, Arduinos, wood & metal tools, and cold drinks, all in the cozy atmosphere of our big industrial-style hall. Come by to help out, chat, and meet new people!

Not a club member yet? Come and get to know us – we love meeting new faces!

Every Thursday starting at 6PM.
