As a non-profit organization under German law, we are required to have statutes (in German). Here they are:

### I. Preamble

Today’s information society is no longer conceivable without computers. The possible uses of automated data processing and data transmission offer opportunities, but also pose risks for individuals and for society.

Information and communication technologies change the relationship between humans and machines and among humans themselves. The development toward an information society requires new forms of knowledge across all parts of society.

Despite ever new and faster forms of communication that can make physical proximity seem unnecessary, personal exchange among people with shared interests in science, technology and digital art cannot be replaced by anything.

Exploring technical possibilities, conducting experiments and assessing the potential impacts of new technologies have a long tradition and form the foundation for any kind of research and further development. Since microprocessors have become affordable for individuals as well, there has been a growing need for new communication platforms in both the physical and the electronic world.

Around open source, free software and internet visionaries, a new active movement has formed. “Hacker culture” in the original sense of the word is characterized by a constructive, playful and progressive approach to technology and is driven by the creative potential that information technology has opened up to the public. We see hacker culture as an important contribution to socio-political development and as a creative driver for technological and societal innovation.

This development and technological progress have made new manufacturing and machining methods such as 3D printing, laser cutting or CAD-controlled milling accessible to private individuals. The possibilities of these new techniques are far from fully explored and offer attractive new fields of activity for people interested in technology as well as design.

Munich Maker Lab aims to advance societal development and global, freely accessible knowledge. Based on collaborative knowledge exchange, the goal is to acquire new knowledge for society through exchange among specialists from a wide range of fields and by connecting different areas of modern technology. Its members work, for example, in areas such as 3D printing, microcontrollers, circuit design, digital democracy, CAD/CAM, electronic music, alternative telecommunications infrastructure, photography, applied cryptography, augmented reality, systems theory, object-oriented and imperative programming from Arduino to Java to shell or Python, as well as the use of new technologies in contemporary art.

### II. Main Part of the Statutes
